                A comfortable place to fill up on all things yoga. The cup of yoga appears to be not quite daily anymore, but there’s more than enough to keep my interest, and a large archive. The guest bloggers are good. There seems to be nothing but guest bloggers lately, however, which is possibly a sign that this popular blog is winding down.</p>

            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/W3MCdjz/faribase.png" alt="" />
            <p>In most scenarios using Authentication, you will want to know whether your users are currently signed-in or signed-out of your application. The module provides a method called onAuthStateChanged which allows you to subscribe to the users current authentication state, and receive an event whenever that state changes.
            It is important to remember the onAuthStateChanged listener is asynchronous and will trigger an initial state once a connection with Firebase has been established. Therefore it is important to setup an "initializing" state which blocks render of our main application whilst the connection is established</p>
